# Project Overview
  * This project uses Java Swing create a GUI that simulates the RIP routing distance vector algorithm by reading in data from a text file.
  * Once run, the first window shows 3 options for the user. The open file button allows the user to enter the name of the input text file to be read. The step button runs the algorithm one step at a time and the run button runs the algorithm until the system of routers is stable.
