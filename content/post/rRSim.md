# Screens Breakdown
  * The first screen is the main/home screen. It welcomes the user and allows a search by film title or by tags. 
  * Once an option is chosen, a text entry box will appear to allow the user to enter the desired text. 
  * Assuming a film title search, and a match is found, the top portion of the screen will display the matching film data. The bottom half of the screen will show a list of recommended films based on the film that was searched. The user will be able to click on any of those titles to see the film's data.
  * The last image shows the main screen when a title search is conducted and a match is not found. A pop up box will inform the user that a match was not found. It will also urge the user to try a tag search to attempt to find similar titles.
