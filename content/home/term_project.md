# Reason for app choice
#### Why would someone need this app? Well, to put it plainly, people, myself included, love movies. The first movie was produced in 1878 for the sole purpose of answering the question: “When a horse trots, do all four hooves leave the ground simultaneously?”.  Movies have come a long way since. In 2018, the film industry took in over $12 billion in box office sales. That’s over 1.5 billion tickets sold. These numbers only represent domestic sales. Technology has also given rise to popular movie services such as Hulu and Netflix that offer users access to thousands of titles. This application will help users browse through titles that they will hopefully enjoy.
